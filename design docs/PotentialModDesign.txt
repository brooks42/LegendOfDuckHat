The mods could be python files, mixed with a resource bundle. So the main game could just be a "mod" to the game's engine, with a couple of resource bundles for player sprites, UI, etc. User mods could modify those resource bundles (maybe something like iOS, with bundle/resource URLs that can be overridden based on loading), and then extend or implement some of the code to make the mods function - or we can have a simple Mod interface that registers and installs mods in a directory, something like Factorio?
