# LegendOfDuckHat

<p>A simple Python game. Should be fun.</p>

<p>In Legend of Duckhat, the goal is to have the player walk around a procedurally-generated world and find dungeons. In the dungeons are monsters (duh) that the player fights, and in one dungeon in every world is that world's Hat. Hats are what hold a planet together, and when the last hat is removed from a world... the world dies.</p>

<p>A few simple words to describe Legend of Duckhat: multiplayer, side-scroller, hack-n-slash, hopefully fun.</p>

<p>It's intended that the game be open-source, even on release - that it be free to play (maybe donations, that would be nice) and very mod-friendly.</p>
